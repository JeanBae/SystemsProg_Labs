## Reflection

The TA mentioned to make a vector of vectors of strings and I utilized that to
push back processes into one vector, to then push back into the larger vector.
I used another vector of vectors of strings to then push back the process arguments
using stringstream. I used stringstream again to get the jobs. I think I followed
my initial plan in my brainstorm but didn't think I'd use stringstream but
that turned out to be a lot easier.
