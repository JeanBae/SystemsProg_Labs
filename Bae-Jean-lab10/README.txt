## Instructions

To clean my code, type make clean in the command line:

$ make clean

To compile my code, type make all:

$ make all

To run my code after compiling, type ./stat (while in the Bae-Jean-lab09 directory)

$ ./rm [file_name...]

## Reflection
It was difficult to think recursively but collaborated with my cohorts, named below, and we
managed to discuss a way to recursively do it. We had bools to set whether there was a
-r or -f or -rf on the command line and then called the function on itself through
each directory and/or file. That was probably the most difficult part of the lab, other than
that, I reused some of the code from the stat lab.


Cohorts: David Luo and Stone Daniel

Used example code for readdir below
